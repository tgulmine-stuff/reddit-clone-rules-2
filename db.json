        "If you have a response to an existing post, reply to it in the comments section instead of making your own post about it.\n\nIf you have something to say about a topic currently on the front page, please say it as a comment in the already front page post.",

Whether or not if you agree with the practice, copyright infringement will not be tolerated. There are plenty of other sites on the internet where you can do it; if you must, go wild there, but not here, please.\n\nEnabling or attempting to enable piracy will result in a permanent ban.",

No hotlinking or rehosting someone else's work (unless they specifically allow it in their terms of use or request it).",

Posts to your personal videos or channels may be removed even if you're not monetizing them, just getting started or just thought it was cool. Generally speaking, due to the nature of their timeliness most streams may not be well-suited for this subreddit.\n\nAll users must abide by reddit's general rules of promotion, which allow 10% max on submissions.",
        "Submissions about new projects or major updates to existing ones are allowed. If you have or know of a project you're excited about, that's great! We want you to share it with the community, but we don't need nag posts every day directing people back to the crowd funding page. A new post for a project is allowed if it's been updated in a significant way.",
